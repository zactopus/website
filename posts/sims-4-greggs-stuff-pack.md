This is a work-in-progress stuff pack to make your very own [UK-based bakery chain Greggs](https://www.greggs.co.uk/) in the Sims.

This is not endorsed by Greggs at all, but if they want to give me a lifetime supply of vegan sausage rolls they are more than welcome to.

## What is included?

### CAS

- **Uniform**: Full Body - Apron, in feminine and masculine versions
- **Cap**: Hat

I don't like that there are 'feminine' and 'masculine' labels when it really means does the model have breasts but this is how Sims 4 labels them in game...

### Build mode

_Search for 'greggs'_

- **Greggs sign**: Signage for your Greggs. (Requires Get to Work expansion pack)

## Game Requirements

- Base game for uniform.
- Get to Work for the sign (and if you want to make a bakery...)

## Credits/Thanks

- The uniform are recolors of the apron and cap in the base game.
- The sign is a recolor of the Get to Work "Backlit Screen Print Sign, From Andre's Big Banners"
- Gregg's logo made with the [Nootrasim Simlish font by Franzilla](https://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=584840)
- Made with [Sims 4 Studio](https://sims4studio.com/)
- Thanks to Anna for feedback and testing

## Planned additions

- Sausage rolls (with vegan variant)
- Bakes (with vegan variant)
- Coffee/tea to go cups
- More posters/propaganda
- Various Greggs clutter
